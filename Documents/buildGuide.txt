// Choose housing

	There are 2 options for housings:
	1. The quickest and easiest is the generic barrel (pic housing1) that only works with generic sleeves like (https://www.amazon.com/LeLuv-Penis-Magic-Sleeve-Pussy/dp/B0733J8QXR) and has limited adjustability (only key plate spacers), but only requires 1 3d printed part and 4 heat set inserts.
	2. The other and best option is the modular system that works with the generic sleeves above and regular sized Fleshlights through adapters.  The fit can also be customized through stabilizer adapters. (pic housing2, housing3)
