	6. Plug the free end of the QWIIC cable into the T-Display and align the electronics section as shown in (pic electronics5).
	7. Flip the electronics section over and screw the assembly together with 4 X 16mm M3 screws (pic electronics6).
	8. Install key switches and keycaps (pic electronics7).
	*Electronics housing is not waterproof so keep it dry.

// Choose housing

	There are two options for housings:
	1. The quickest and easiest is the generic barrel (pic housing1) that only works with generic sleeves like (https://www.amazon.com/LeLuv-Penis-Magic-Sleeve-Pussy/dp/B0733J8QXR) and has limited adjustability (only key plate spacers), but only requires 1 3D-printed part and 4 heat set inserts.
	2. The other and best option is the modular system that works with the generic sleeves above and regular sized Fleshlights through adapters. The fit can also be customized through stabilizer adapters. (pic housing2, housing3)
		a. The housing will work with the end caps from a regular fleshlight housing. If you want to print your own version of the regular end cap, print the flEndcap (no heat set inserts required).
		b. To print an upgraded version of the endcap, choose the ARRI or ultimate end cap that work with camera rigging gear for unlimited mounting and attachment options. (pic fleshlightEndCaps)
		*ARRI - a central 1/4"-20 heat set insert surrounded by holes for ARRI locating pins. Printing the arriFlEndCap requires 1 X 1/4"-20 heat set inserts.
		*Ultimate - the ARRI end cap mounting points plus 7 surrounding heat set inserts. The additional inserts provide more mointing points, and some are spaced according to camera rigging "cheese plate" standards for even more mounting options. Printing the ultimateFlEndCap requires 8 X 1/4"-20 heat set inserts.
